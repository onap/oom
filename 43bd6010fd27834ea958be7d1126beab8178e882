      "message": "Hi Sylvain - thanks for feedback. The backend is supported by mariaDB technology, and this specific user and password are provisioned when the backend POD/docker container comes up. Meaning - we have to use the same user name/password (non-root) to access the backend...Typically, the operations team also needs to sometimes login into the backend, and they need to know the username/password (available to only select folks, based on values.yaml file)...Please advise if there is a way to create random user name/password that are used by multiple front-end and back-end docker containers and also somehow we could extract them ... Per previous code, unfortunately, we were using root user name and password, and here we are trying to create non-root user...Thank you",
