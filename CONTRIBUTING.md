# Contributing to OOM

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to OOM!
Please see some information on how to do it.

## How to become a contributor and submit your own code

### Environment setup
In order to be able to check on your side before submitting, you'll need to install some binaries:

* helm (satisfying the targeted version as seen in [setup guide](
docs/oom_cloud_setup_guide.rst#software-requirements)).
* chartmuseum (in order to push dependency charts)
* helm push (version 0.10.1 as of today)
* make

### Linting and testing
OOM uses helm linting in order to check that the template rendering is correct with default values.

The first step is to start chartmuseum:

``` shell
nohup chartmuseum --storage="local" --storage-local-rootdir="/tmp/chartstorage" \
  --port 6464 &
```
or
``` shell
docker-compose up
```

then you add a `local` repository to helm:
```shell
helm repo remove local || helm repo add local http://localhost:6464
```

As full rendering may be extremely long (~9h), you may only want to lint the common part and the component you're working on.
Here's an example with AAI:
```shell
cd kubernetes
make common && make aai
```

If you work on a non default path, it's strongly advised to also render the
template of your component / subcomponent to be sure it's as expected.

Here's an example enabling service mesh on aai graphadmin:

```shell
cd aai/components/
helm template --release-name onap --debug \
  --set global.ingress.virtualhost.baseurl=toto \
  --set global.ingress.enabled=true \
  --set global.masterPassword="toto" \
  --set global.serviceMesh.enabled=true \
  --set global.serviceMesh.tls=true \
  aai-graphadmin
```
All the output will be rendered YAML if everything works as expected or an error if something goes wrong.
Usually the errors come from bad indentation or unknown values.

### Contributing a Patch
1. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
2. Sign the LFN CLA (<https://www.onap.org/cla>)
3. Submit a pull request.
4. Work with the reviewers on their suggestions.
5. Ensure to rebase to the HEAD of your target branch and [squash un-necessary commits](https://blog.carbonfive.com/always-squash-and-rebase-your-git-commits/)
   before finally mergin your contribution.
