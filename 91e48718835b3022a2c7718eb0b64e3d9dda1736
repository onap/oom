      "message": "This is true, however, we actually need to move (or mirror) docker hub and other images in nexus 3. I have an outstanding ticket with the LF on providing this for us. I also have an action to move all oomks artifacts into nexus3.\nI will be raising another patch shortly that should provide you with exactly what you are looking for, in the form of a new _repository.tpl in the common chart. This will allow a default repository to be overridden with a global repository value and then, if need be, have the global value overridden on a per chart basis using a repositoryOverride configuration value.",
