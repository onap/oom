      "message": "It should not break the offline installer.  These URLs are not used during the installation process at all.\n\nWhen a user designs a DCAE service using dcaemod, dcaemod generates a Cloudify blueprint for the service, and it includes these URLs as \"imports\", somewhat analagous to importing type files in C or C++.   When a user then goes to deploy a DCAE service created through dcaemod, the blueprints are processed by Cloudify Manager, which uses these URLs to find information about data types.  In order to accommodate operation in environments where there is limited network connectivity, Cloudify Manager has an \"import resolver\" that maps import URLs to locations on Cloudify Manager\u0027s local file system.  Our Cloudify Manager container has the corresponding files loaded (during the Docker image build) and has the import resolver configured to map these URLs.  \n\nSo even after installation, the dcaemod design and deployment mechanism will work even without full internet access.",
