      "message": "I understand Krzysztof, anyway I did not have any User Story on clamp side to track that for Frankfurt.\nNevermind, i\u0027m not sure of those values anyway.\nHere is what I propose for now:\nI\u0027ll kick them from this review so that there is no new visible password added.\n\nAnd I \u0027ll rework the entire file (We still have some for policy/dcae as you can see) in another PR so that no password is visible in this file (i have just created that ticket https://jira.onap.org/browse/CLAMP-796). I\u0027ll do it now.\n\nI don\u0027t want to block the CL testing on SB-01 due to that.\nDoes it sound reasonable for you ?\n\nAlso, i\u0027m wondering if that rework is really desired because the main problem I see here is that i should not store any basic creds to access DCAE or policy at all, this is a total non sense ! \nI guess the creds from the clamp user should be sent (one way encrypted, or a user certificate?) to policy and dcae, so that they could authenticate/verify the permissions of that user as well. \nI guess the system is totally broken(split brain?) here.\nIs there any common strategy decided for that ? (service mesh?)",

      "message": "SÃ©bastien, the endgoal is not not to have hardcoded and/or viewable credentials in these files.\n\nthe (semi) end goal is that for example CDS generate a password at first install for clamp and store it in a secret. Then CLAMP would use this secret to retrieve the data.\nThis way, every new deployment gets a new password and we can work on securing secrets.\n\nlonger term goal (IMO) would be to have an user (and not a component) credential but it requires a lot of refactoring in every components and in the way to check / verify the creds (here Service Mesh could help also)",
