      "message": "As this policy is not instantiated by default under PDP, this patch should have caused healthcheck failure in gating (as policy-sync container attempts to retrieve the policy, it would error and halt the deployment)\n\nSuggest below options for activating policy flow\n1) Work with Policy Project team to preload this policy on ONAP/Policy instantiation\n2) Include these lines commented and provide instruction under SliceAnalysis documentation (under RTD) for creating the policy and redeploying the SliceAnalysis charts to include necessary policies overrides for supporting the required usecase.\n\nBTW, did you verify locally if the runtime policy updates were cascading to Slice service correctly? Recall you noted issue with son-handler policy test hence wondering if anything similar noticed for slice-ms.",
