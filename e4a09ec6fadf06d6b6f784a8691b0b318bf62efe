If this identity was present with AAF, we`d clearly go for certInitializer.\n\nNow, we`d be rebasing this one, based on gerrit 111328, if it would be possible to use certInitializer, we`d immediately go for it.\n\nOtherwise, we`d have to stay with this apporach, unless we find a way to add new app identities to AAF.",
