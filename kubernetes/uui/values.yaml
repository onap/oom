  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
  #
  # Example:
  # Configure resource requests and limits
  # ref: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/compute-resources/
  # Minimum memory for development is 2 CPU cores and 4GB memory
  # Minimum memory for production is 4 CPU cores and 8GB memory
