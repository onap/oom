OOM Cloud Setup Guide
#####################

OOM deploys and manages ONAP on a pre-established Kubernetes_ cluster - the
creation of this cluster is outside of the scope of the OOM project as there
are many options including public clouds with pre-established environments.
However, this guide includes instructions for how to create and use some of the
more popular environments which could be used to host ONAP. If creation of a
Kubernetes cluster is required, the life-cycle of this cluster is independent
of the life-cycle of the ONAP components themselves. Much like an OpenStack
environment, the Kubernetes environment may be used for an extended period of
time, possibly spanning multiple ONAP releases.

.. note::
  Inclusion of a cloud technology or provider in this guide does not imply an
  endorsement.

.. _Kubernetes: https://kubernetes.io/

Software Requirements
=====================

The versions of Kubernetes that are supported by OOM are as follows:

.. table:: OOM Software Requirements

  ==============     ===========  =======  ========  ======== ============
  Release            Kubernetes   Helm     kubectl   Docker   Cert-Manager
  ==============     ===========  =======  ========  ======== ============
  amsterdam          1.7.x        2.3.x    1.7.x     1.12.x
  beijing            1.8.10       2.8.2    1.8.10    17.03.x
  casablanca         1.11.5       2.9.1    1.11.5    17.03.x
  dublin             1.13.5       2.12.3   1.13.5    18.09.5
  el alto            1.15.2       2.14.2   1.15.2    18.09.x
  frankfurt          1.15.9       2.16.6   1.15.11   18.09.x
  guilin             1.15.11      2.16.10  1.15.11   18.09.x
  honolulu           1.19.9       3.5.2    1.19.9    19.03.x   1.2.0
  Istanbul           1.19.11      3.6.3    1.19.11   19.03.x   1.5.4
  ==============     ===========  =======  ========  ======== ============

.. note::
  Guilin version also supports Kubernetes up to version 1.19.x and should work
  with Helm with version up to 3.3.x but has not been thoroughly tested.

Minimum Hardware Configuration
==============================

The hardware requirements are provided below. Note that this is for a
full ONAP deployment (all components). Customizing ONAP to deploy only
components that are needed will drastically reduce the requirements.

.. table:: OOM Hardware Requirements

  =====  =====  ======  ====================
  RAM    HD     vCores  Ports
  =====  =====  ======  ====================
  224GB  160GB  112     0.0.0.0/0 (all open)
  =====  =====  ======  ====================

.. note::
  Kubernetes supports a maximum of 110 pods per node - configurable in the
  --max-pods=n setting off the "additional kubelet flags" box in the kubernetes
  template window described in 'ONAP Development - 110 pod limit Wiki'
  - this limit does not need to be modified . The use of many small nodes is
  preferred over a few larger nodes (for example 14x16GB - 8 vCores each).
  Subsets of ONAP may still be deployed on a single node.

Cloud Installation
==================

.. #. OOM supports deployment on major public clouds. The following guides
..    provide instructions on how to deploy ONAP on these clouds:
..
..    - `Microsoft Azure`_,
..    - `Amazon AWS`_,
..    - `Google GCE`_,
..    - `VMware VIO`_,
..    - IBM, and
..    - `Openstack`_.
..
.. #. Alternatively, OOM can be deployed on a private set of physical hosts or
..    VMs (or even a combination of the two). The following guides describe how
..    to create a Kubernetes cluster with popular tools:
..
..    - `Setting up Kubernetes with Rancher`_ (recommended)
..    - `Setting up Kubernetes with Kubeadm`_
..    - `Setting up Kubernetes with Cloudify`_

OOM can be deployed on a private set of physical hosts or VMs (or even a
combination of the two). The following guide describe the recommended method to
setup a Kubernetes cluster: :ref:`onap-on-kubernetes-with-rancher`.

There are alternative deployment methods described on the
`Cloud Native Deployment Wiki`_
