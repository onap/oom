      "message": "I am fully with You Krzysztof, but... the versions present in this container must be aligned with versions in the MultiCloud/K8S plugin. Essentially, this container will execute validations of CNF Helm charts, against Helm client present in the MultiCloud/K8S, to confirm, that the Helm chart is deployable by MultiCloud/K8S. Today, MultiCLoud/K8S still uses Helm 2.x (2.17 if I recall properly).\n\nIf we could convince MultiCloud/K8S to update to Helm 3.x libraries, then we can immediately remove the Helm v2 client from this image.\n\n@Lukasz Rajewski:\nAny news on this one? Do You know, when is the MultiCloud-K8S moving to Helm 3.x?",
