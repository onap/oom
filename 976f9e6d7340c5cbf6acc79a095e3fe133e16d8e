      "message": "The 3.0.0 changes are implemented to cooperate with the Clamp Casablanca changes, which have AAF integrated. 2.0.0 is for Clamp Beijing release, which uses another way for user authentication/authorization. The 2 version shall not be mixed up, otherwise it will not work. That\u0027s why we want to put all the changes in 3.0.0. \nMaybe we can just keep it 3.0.0 here. And of course this version will not be used until the requirements.yaml is updated. What do you think?",
