I propose to use them with -qq and a few other tricks.\ncf https://gerrit.onap.org/r/c/oom/+/126205\n\nAlso with the --yes option, installed packages might depend on a newer version of python3 that would be automatically installed.\nI understand the image python:3.7 here is maintained by Gitlab but I don\u0027t know the details how.\nSo I cannot completely evacuate the risk that a python version different than 3.7 will be finally used at the end in this section.\nIs this so problematic? Nothing is less sure ðŸ˜Š\nWhether or  not, maybe a different image would be more indicated here.\nI observed these commands lead to the installation of a lot of packages purposely removed by the Gitlab maintainers. And this takes a lot of time, about as long as the linters execution time itself...",
