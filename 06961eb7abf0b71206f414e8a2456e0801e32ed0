Another option that Dan suggests is if you want to include the namespace, which will also work, it would have to to be like this: https://policy-xacml-pdp.{{.Release.Namespace}}:6969/policy/pdpx/v1/decision (since \"onap\" may be different across installations).\n\nMake sure too that the username and password are correct to interface with this component though, the default one is healthcheck / zb!XztG34 .   I noticed that the polBasicAuth in line 87 base64 does not translate to those credentials.",
