      "message": "This is the first plugin published with SDC, but this folder can contain other plugins (jars).\n\nYou are right, we could embed this inside the application container, but I believe also that way we can configure which jars will be injected or not in the sdc-be plugin folder, during deployment time, by just adding or removing the plugin init images here.\n\nThat is the way we are doing in house that contains other plugins built outside the sdc build process.",

      "message": "Hmm ok but this container is run unconditionally so there is no config option to disable it apart from modifying charts.\n\nI\u0027m rather skeptical here:\n\n1) Docker images should be immutable\n2) Docker images should be stateless as much as possible\n3) If you just take SDC image and run it in docker it would have way different content than the one that is run here\n4) We need to maintain a separate docker image for every plugin\n5) Size of deployment is bigger as this base image has to contain at least core utils to allow you to copy those\n\n@Sylvain\nWhat\u0027s your opinion on this?",
