      "message": "It\u0027s just because a stupid helm convention that every template returns it\u0027s value as a string. So if I drop the default here this template would return either \"true\" or \"false\" strings. The if you pass that to if both of them are considered true as they are non-zero length strings. What this default gives as is that it returns an empty string (which is considered false in helm) if they key value is false.\n\nUltimately I\u0027d obviously prefer to use some strToBool function and just do the conversion after calling this template but I\u0027ve not found any function like this.",
