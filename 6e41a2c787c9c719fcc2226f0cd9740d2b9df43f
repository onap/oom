      "message": "because we don\u0027t need it if RAM \u003e 8G\nand new_heap is roughly tied to cpus.\nto be honest, I think that if someone wants to change the values, he has to read how to do it because it\u0027s not easy to automate (in particular because of metrics unit abbrev are different) as we\u0027re quite limited with go template language.\n\nSo, we have 3 cases:\n* no limits so MAX_HEAP_SIZE, HEAP_NEW_SIZE won\u0027t be set. As we certainly have more than 8gb, it\u0027s not an issue\n* \"big\" flavor, MAX_HEAP_SIZE, HEAP_NEW_SIZE won\u0027t be set. As we certainly have more than 8gb, it\u0027s not an issue\n* \"small\" flavor is used, MAX_HEAP_SIZE, HEAP_NEW_SIZE will be set. As we certainly have less than 8gb, it\u0027s not an issue. Even if it\u0027s more than 8G, you can set the values accordingly.\n\nIf someone wants to be smart and use \"specific\" values with \"big\" flavor but less than 8Gb, too bad for him (it\u0027s the only case where we can have troubles)",
