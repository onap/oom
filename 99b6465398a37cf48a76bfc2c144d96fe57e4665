      "message": "I am fully with You Krzysztof, but... the versions present in this container must be aligned with versions in the MultiCloud/K8S plugin. Essentially, this container will execute validations of CNF Helm charts, against Helm client present in the MultiCloud/K8S, to confirm, that the Helm chart is deployable by MultiCloud/K8S. Today, MultiCLoud/K8S still uses Helm 2.x (2.17 if I recall properly).\n\nIf we could convince MultiCloud/K8S to update to Helm 3.x libraries, then we can immediately remove the Helm v2 client from this image.\n\n@Lukasz Rajewski:\nAny news on this one? Do You know, when is the MultiCloud-K8S moving to Helm 3.x?",

      "message": "Hi, I confirm that k8splugin today uses Helm libraries (not the application) of version 2.14.3. There is an open bug with target to be fixed in Honolulu to migrate to Helm 3 library because we observe more and more problems with processing of new helm charts. So very soon we should have Helm 3.5 in the plugin - for sure in Istanbul, not sure if this will be included into Honolulu already - depends on timing.",
