      "message": "As this policy is not instantiated by default under PDP, this patch should have caused healthcheck failure in gating (as policy-sync container attempts to retrieve the policy, it would error and halt the deployment)\n\nSuggest below options for activating policy flow\n1) Work with Policy Project team to preload this policy on ONAP/Policy instantiation\n2) Include these lines commented and provide instruction under SliceAnalysis documentation (under RTD) for creating the policy and redeploying the SliceAnalysis charts to include necessary policies overrides for supporting the required usecase.\n\nBTW, did you verify locally if the runtime policy updates were cascading to Slice service correctly? Recall you noted issue with son-handler policy test hence wondering if anything similar noticed for slice-ms.",

      "message": "Okay good suggestions. Thanks I will follow, and will update documentation for runtime configuration. Yeah, I have verified it, runtime configuration works correctly. Later that day I found policy sync will update data every 20 minutes. I modified it to 5s in local env, and I can see it\u0027s running in real time. So it\u0027s working no problem.\n\nBTW, can i know where you got the policy sync error logs \"cannot connect to host policy-xacml-pdp:6969\". I didn\u0027t find it on jenkins.",
