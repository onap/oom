      "message": "We used this same approach in Dublin in the dcae-bootstrap, dcae-deployment-handler, and dcae-policy-handler charts.\nWe do expect (or at least hope) that eventually TLS certificate setup will be done by an ONAP-wide image that would be specified through a global value.\nIf we need to change this to a non-global value, we will need to change the three charts we delivered in Dublin as well.  Is this necessary?",
