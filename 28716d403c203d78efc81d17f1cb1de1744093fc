      "message": "This image probably won\u0027t exist in the Nexus repo until the component is \"released\".   The automated builds put images into the \"snapshot\" repository, with tags like \"5.0.0-STAGING-latest\".   I believe there\u0027s a manual step that someone at the Linux Foundation needs to run to create a \"released\" image.\nNot sure if we should put the released tag here now, or put in the -STAGING-latest tag, or simply hold this change until the policy handler image is released.",
