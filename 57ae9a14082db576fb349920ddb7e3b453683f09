      "message": "My aim was to centralize everything so that if you want to change password you do it at only one place (api-credentials above). This is the last part of that puzzle, which I could not fix only with chart changes. The issue is that these AES hashes are generated using a key and an InitVector. The helm function for creating AES hashes does not support this. So this will require code changes in CDS. At least now it is extracted from the application.properties file and can be overridden, that is a small improvement.",
