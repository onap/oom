      "message": "If I understand your concern, this sidecar container exists only in Dublin OOM deployment to support a very thin python script mocking of sunny day responses from \"SO\" in support of the integration health check and CSIT testcase. The risk of this failing on a python patch version is very small. \n\nThere are no finer grained python containers in nexus3.onap.org readily available, so mitigating this risk would require building of a custom container.\n\nThere is regular CMSO CSIT robot docker container that runs this mocking service that we use in the regular CSIT job, but this will be changing to support rainy day scenarios. It would seem excessive to run this as a sidecar container for this purpose, but this would address your concern.",
