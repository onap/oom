      "message": "nope it doesn\u0027t. As this component used to create the actual secret I assumed that it is the owner of this password thus if cloudifyManagerPassword is not set our template will just generate one.\n\nFor other components you may see that I\u0027ve set the policy: required which is typical for \"password consumers\". So in that case they expect that the password has to be given by the parent chart and if it\u0027s not they\u0027ll just fail the deployment but to allow to lint them I set this to some random value",
