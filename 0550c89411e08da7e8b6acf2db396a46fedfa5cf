      "message": "So few things here, either we fork the MSO log config and stick to it. Either we fork MSO log config and modify it. Overall, I don\u0027t like forking at all, but currently we have to. In this case, I\u0027d rather fork and not modify so it\u0027s simplier, easier to track, and less error-prone to upgrade. See previous breakage in release-1.1.0 branch. So I get in an ideal world it should be onap, and not ecomp. I can make those change if required. but I\u0027m not for it.\nSo let see what others think wrt this issue.",

      "message": "filebeat looks at /var/log/onap and expects to pickup logs from there. if the logs will be written to another location, filebeat will not ship them to the elk stack. So the current situation is definitely a bug.\nThe design of logging is to make a common logging pattern for all components, effectively forking and modifying the logback.xml files of all components. This effort is in logging-analytics project. Michael O. is the PTL of this project. We did a lot of work in order to implement in OOM (R1) all the stuff developed in logging project. In recent work of taking latest configuration of components, some of this work was lost. Guess we need to go over all the configuration again and make sure the logging features are still intact and fix wherever they aren\u0027t.\nIn light of the above, in my opinion, let\u0027s go with /var/log/onap like in all (most) other components and have a jira to track the logging configuration synchronization in all components.\nMichael, please advise.",
