      "message": "Yes, the Always policy will try to pull all the time, but if the docker image that was downloaded in the past is the exact same as what is available in the docker repo then docker is smart enough to not spend anytime re-downloading the images.  \nIMO, an Always policy is the best way to get updates to the images by using raw k8s.  An extra script/manual step to do this seems like a workaround only your environment needs.  \nNow that we have helm going, if your environment has issues with this, you can simply change the tag of your docker image to a specific build and avoid using \"latest\" or \"STAGING-latest as these are built daily.",
