      "message": "Hi Jack, I think this is good to go. The results pages are broken but I think the bulkpm suite is using your change right? I do see some checks in the dcae apps for dmaap-bc but that will have to be changes in the testsuite repo somewhere.",

      "message": "This isn\u0027t quite ready.  I submitted it as a WIP so that I could see a gating run.  I need to release the drprov-client image, and I also need to change the readiness checks for pm-mapper and datafile-collector, which are currently waiting for a job that runs after bus controller is deployed.   The 5G bulk pm test exercises the DR (the datafile-collector publishes a file to a DR feed, and the pm-mapper subscribes to that feed and receives the file)--that test is working in my local environment and also in gating.  In my local environment it\u0027s possible to see the feed and the subscription that are being created (a query to the DR API shows them) and it\u0027s also possible to see the file being published and delivered by looking at the DR logs after the 5G bulk PM test runs.",
