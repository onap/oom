# ONAP Operations Manager

## Description

The ONAP Operations Manager (OOM) is responsible for life-cycle management of
the ONAP platform itself; components such as SO, SDNC, etc.

It is not responsible for the management of services, VNFs or infrastructure
instantiated by ONAP or used by ONAP to host such services or VNFs.

OOM uses the open-source Kubernetes container management system as a means to
manage the containers that compose ONAP where the containers are hosted either
directly on bare-metal servers or on VMs hosted by a 3rd party management
system.

OOM ensures that ONAP is easily deployable and maintainable throughout its life
cycle while using hardware resources efficiently.

Full documentation is available in ONAP documentation in [operations and
administration guides](
https://docs.onap.org/en/latest/guides/onap-operator/index.html).
