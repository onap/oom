Dummy values are included here to keep the code that consumes this configuration working properly.\n\nThis is not a candidate for a local secret with a generated password.  The password would be used to authenticate to the dmaap bus controller, which is part of a different project.  The bus controller does have the ability to authenticate, but it\u0027s based on AAF, which means that the password would need to be set up in AAF (which AFAIK cannot be configured through secrets at deployment time) and then distributed (somehow) to this client.",
