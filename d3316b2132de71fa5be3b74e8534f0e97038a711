      "message": "I think increasing readiness delay is a mistake.\nThe pod will not be in ready state for 7.5 minutes. dependent pods will also wait.\nOnly liveness pod needs to be increased. Readiness pod needs to be 10 sec.\nFrom https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/:\nThe kubelet uses liveness probes to know when to restart a Container. For example, liveness probes could catch a deadlock, where an application is running, but unable to make progress. Restarting a Container in such a state can help to make the application more available despite bugs.\n\nThe kubelet uses readiness probes to know when a Container is ready to start accepting traffic. A Pod is considered ready when all of its Containers are ready. One use of this signal is to control which Pods are used as backends for Services. When a Pod is not ready, it is removed from Service load balancers.",
