The way we are leaning it to use common.fullname which will prefix the service name with the Release.Name.\nSo the K8s DNS entry here for these apps isn\u0027t really sdc-be.namespace anymore it should be [releasename]-sdc-be.[namespace].  \nWe will merge this as is and next week take another pass to line up service naming.",
