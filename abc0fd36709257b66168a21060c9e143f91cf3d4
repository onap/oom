      "message": "I would prefer to use in service .Values.service.name instead of common.fullname in service definition. This will provide a constant service, instead of one prefixed with the name of the helm deployment (Release.Name). It will enable deploying subsets of onap (components A,C,E in one command and B,D,F in another). Otherwise it is impossible, because the Release.Name part of common.fullname is different for each.",
