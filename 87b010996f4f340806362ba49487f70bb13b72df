      "message": "Ideally, we would not like to deal with the assignment and management of using node ports, in the future. Especially seeing as there is a limitation of having a maximum of 5 ranges in use per k8s cluster. \n\nThe MSB project may be of interest here to help provide routing into the k8s containers from a single external address.\n\nFor now, this is a welcome evolutionary improvement over the use of a single fixed node port range.",
