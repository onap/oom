Instead of asking for context, would compare it to the actual and either return an error or do the delete.\nThis would eliminate the need to provide an input interactively, after all we are trying to reach automation and are probably not the final link in the chain of execution (e.g. CI/CD, automatic system creation scripts etc.).",
