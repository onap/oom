      "message": "You are right but I think this was done wrongly in OOM in the first place. Actually, we don\u0027t have only one RIC, instead we may have multiple RICs and the information about all of them should be put in this json file. See an example configuration here:\nhttps://gerrit.o-ran-sc.org/r/gitweb?p\u003dnonrtric.git;a\u003dblob;f\u003ddocker-compose/policy-service/config/application_configuration.controller.json;h\u003dcf97ed98b0a75982936c658c3f33c18da3f7f789;hb\u003dHEAD\n\nSo, we need to have multiple ricLinks depending on how many RICs the user has provisioned. I don\u0027t think we can use override file to include multiple RICs here.",
