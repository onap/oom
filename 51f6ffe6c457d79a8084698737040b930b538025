      "message": "Why is it necessary to remove these exports?  Wouldn\u0027t they be needed if a publisher did not provide a username and/or password and let dmaap-bc generate them? Or are we requiring all components that need a publisher to use a secret to set the username/password explicitly?\n\nLetting the dmaap-bc pick a username and password eliminates the problem of duplicate publisher entries and meets security requirements because the password is generated by dmaap-bc at the time the publisher is created.  The password never appears in a values.yaml file.",
