      "message": "I should have paid more attention to the wiki page, I didn\u0027t see these 311 prefix getting used.\nYou should use either 302 or 304 for prefix, please.\n\nThe value nodePortPrefix is usually the same all accross the board, which is 302. We have another placeholder, which is nodePortPrefixExt holding value 304.\n\nThe conviniency of having those two consistent accross ONAP is that you can override them at one place, and it gets propagated, as it belongs to the \u0027global\u0027 config.\n\nIf you could get a port in the 302 or 304 range, depending on whether this is an internal ONAP port and a port for external communication, that would be great.\n\nThanks",
