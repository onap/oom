      "message": "wondering the reason for the 1.1.1 tag and why you decided not  to use 1.1.0?  We don\u0027t really have a rule around this version number but I\u0027ve been treating it as a major/minor release thing.  and this change is still part of a major release of 1.1.0 that we are all working on.  If say, these logging changes came in after all the 1.1.0 changes were done and tested I could see the use of 1.1.1 as tag.  If the reason is to enable independent testing of the config pod before merging then I would suggest tagging and pushing to a local (internal to your environment) nexus and test using that.",

      "message": "The reason for the new image (tag 1.1.1) is that Michael in a previous comment stated that it is impossible to test the commit without the docker image. Therefore we provided one.I was thinking on Major/Minor/Patch numbering, since we have 3 digits. Guess we need to discuss this further. Didn\u0027t want to step on 1.1.0, since this commit is not yet submitted. We indeed tested this locally with another tag. If you prefer, I will push an image with 1.1.0 with these changes as well.",
