# hack explanation:
# since the dmaap-bc SSL certificate is expired in this release, we
# pass the -k flag to ignore the cert check error.
# AFAIK, this post-install script is the only client which actually
# uses https (against dmaap-bc API) in El Alto Release.
# So, this workaround is the easiest way out for me.
# Also note that the only reason to even deploy dmaap-bc is if you
# need authenticated topics in message-router, or a feed in data-router.
# If that is not your case, then don't even deploy dmaap-bc.
