# Contributing to OOM

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to OOM!
Please see some information on how to do it.

## Local setup

### Install helm-push plugin

In order to push locally built charts to chartmuseum, the `helm-push` plugin must be installed. You can do that with:

```sh
$ helm plugin install https://github.com/chartmuseum/helm-push
Downloading and installing helm-push v0.10.4 ...
https://github.com/chartmuseum/helm-push/releases/download/v0.10.3/helm-push_0.10.4_linux_amd64.tar.gz
Installed plugin: cm-push
```

### Run chartmuseum

``` shell
mkdir -p charts && docker-compose up
```
or
``` shell
nohup chartmuseum --storage="local" --storage-local-rootdir="/tmp/chartstorage" \
  --port 6464 &
```

### Add a `local` chart repository

OOM contains `make` files that build the charts and push them to the local chartmuseum.
For that to work, helm needs to know about the `local` helm repository.
```shell
helm repo remove local; helm repo add local http://localhost:6464
```

### Linting and testing
OOM uses helm linting in order to check that the template rendering is correct with default values.

As full rendering may be extremely long (~9h), you may only want to lint the common part and the component you're working on.
Here's an example with AAI:
```shell
cd kubernetes
make common && make aai
```

If you work on a non default path, it's strongly advised to also render the
template of your component / subcomponent to be sure it's as expected.

Here's an example enabling service mesh on aai graphadmin:

```shell
cd aai/components/
helm template --release-name onap --debug \
  --set global.ingress.virtualhost.baseurl=toto \
  --set global.ingress.enabled=true \
  --set global.masterPassword="toto" \
  --set global.serviceMesh.enabled=true \
  --set global.serviceMesh.tls=true \
  aai-graphadmin
```
All the output will be rendered YAML if everything works as expected or an error if something goes wrong.
Usually the errors come from bad indentation or unknown values.

### Contributing a Patch
1. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
2. Sign the LFN CLA (<https://www.onap.org/cla>)
3. Submit a pull request.
4. Work with the reviewers on their suggestions.
5. Ensure to rebase to the HEAD of your target branch and [squash un-necessary commits](https://blog.carbonfive.com/always-squash-and-rebase-your-git-commits/)
   before finally mergin your contribution.
