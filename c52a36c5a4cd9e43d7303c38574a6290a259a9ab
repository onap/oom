      "message": "Hello Kryzstof,are you aware of the idea? the parent chart create DBs using the common mariadb-galera + mariadb-init, generate credentials to all of them and pass these credentials to sub-components using helm hooks. Sub-charts doesn\u0027t create any DB nor generate credentials.\n\nThis value presented here just to pass linting, it is the default value and should be overwritten by helm hook from the parent chart if needed.\n\n\"hasSuffix\" trick has been used in the parent component (Policy), it won\u0027t add any value here as whatever secret passed by the parent component, should be directly used by the sub-component to access mariadb.\n\nTo have holistic view,\nPolicy (parent component) create DB either local or common, generate passwords, \"hasSuffix\" used to update external secret, pass all needed info to all sub-components using helm hook.\nPolicy-API (sub-component) consumes the provided info to access the pre-created DB.",

      "message": "Ok so I was dumb and didn\u0027t realize that the hasSuffix would be useless here but I\u0027m still curious why you need any value here to pass the linting?\n\nNormally if externalSecret is evaluated to null the chart will try to create a secret using user and password so it should be all fine. So if:\n{{ tpl (default \"\" (index .Values \"mariadb-galera\" \"db\" \"externalSecret\")) . }}\nevaluates to null or empty string we should be all fine with the linting.",
