      "message": "Thanks for your remark. I\u0027d be happy to come with you to some agreement about it, as I\u0027d like to follow up this change with a few more in the same manner ðŸ˜Š.\nSo, I was thinking about putting such vars into \"global\" in order to enable easy, onap-wide change for all the components that could use sdnc-oam contact point. If you prefer to define such vars on local scope of chart, please tell me why, so we could think about some good placement then ðŸ˜Š.\n\nI\u0027ve also doubled this information in main chart and subcharts so that subcharts could be deployed on it\u0027s own (not sure if particular components allow such functionality, but that\u0027s nothing bad, I think). This wasn\u0027t your concern I think, but it\u0027s safe to ensure.",

You can use them and in certain cases it\u0027s even recommended but this becomes nasty when you abuse them;)\n\nWhen we migrate to service mesh we would have some better solutions as described here:\nhttps://istio.io/blog/2020/multi-cluster-mesh-automation/\n\nbut we are defiantly not yet there so let\u0027s go with this as is until we have better idea or we run into serious issues with this approach.",
