      "message": "Knowing that the OOM team is very particular about how the charts are organized, I looked (but not exhaustively!) for examples.  Unfortunately, I did not come across an example of a Deployment that uses a PVC.  I did find statefulsets that use volume claim templates, which I considered to be a close approximation, and the claim templates are *not* in a separate file.\n\nIs there a document anywhere explaining the OOM style rules for constructing charts?  It is inefficient to discover them through code reviews.  Changing a working chart after it has been tested in order to meet a style requirement is inefficient.",
