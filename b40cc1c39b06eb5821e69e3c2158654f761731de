      "message": "this is breaking ONAP as port_protocol is using values not allowed by service spec (https://logs.onap.org/onap-integration/gating//122348-13/k8s/k8s/onap-helm/onap-aaf.log)\nalso, port_protocol was meant with istio/linkerd in view with a lot more options than allowed (and upcased values) by service spec (TCP, UDP and SCTP).\n\nso I guess we should either\n* use (yet another) name \n* don\u0027t set the protocol",

      "message": "The problem here is not with \"port_protocol\", the problem is with \"protocol\" (or, more precisely, service.ports[i].protocol in the values.yaml.  Prior to the present change, \"protocol\" was not used at all by this template.)  \n\nIt seems that some aaf components, for whatever reason, included service.ports[i].protocol in their values.yaml file. For instance:\n            service:\n              name: aaf-gui\n              type: NodePort\n              ports:\n                - name: gui\n                  protocol: http\n                  port: 8200\n                  nodePort: 51\nThe master branch version of this template just ignores \"protocol\", but this new version of the template tries to use the \"protocol\" value to render a k8s Service file, and \"http\" is not a valid value.\n\nI see two reasonable approaches to fixing this:\n(1) Remove the spurious service.ports[i].protocol settings from the various aaf values.yaml files.  (From a grep through the oom tree, it appears aaf is the only component that is setting these values. aaf-hello, aaf-cm, aaf-fs, aaf-locate, aaf-oauth, aaf-gui, and aaf-service would be affected.)\n(2) Change the name of values.yaml parameter from \"protocol\" to something like \"layer4Protocol\", which would affect the _service.tpl file and the values.yaml file for dcae-snmp-trap-collector.  We could leave the aaf values.yaml files unchanged, and the spurious \"protocol\" values would be ignored.\n\nAny preferences here?",
