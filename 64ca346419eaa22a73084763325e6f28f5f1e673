      "message": "@sirisha, @fiachra -\n\nCurrently policy topics for dmaap for communication between components are currently unauthenticated, they go over TLS but no authentication is produced against DMaaP server.    I suppose this may be the same at least for other components as well, specially those that we interact with DCAE, etc ..\n\nThe question is, would it be allowed with strimzi to use equivalent unauthenticated topics (so no user authentication)?\n\nIf user authentication is required, what are the responsibilities at the application level, ie, java, python, etc .. do we need to add new functionality to make sure username/password is passed to the java, etc.. libraries?",
