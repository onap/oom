There is just more indirection.\nTHe proper solution for this is to change AAF to use derived passwords and store them into secrets that DCAE (and other AAF users) could access.\nPossibly adding the secret now will mean slightly less work in the future if the change is made to AAF, but apart from that I see no benefit and only added complexity.",

      "message": "It was possible previously to change the password at deployment time, since the password information was in values.yaml.  Your change makes no difference.  In the new version and in the previous version, it\u0027s necessary to change the passwords not only for the microservices but also (separately) for the servers that are authenticating them.  It takes coordinated changes in two places.\n\nAlso, the change you made is not working.  It doesn\u0027t pass verification.  It\u0027s probably a simple fix, but since the problem is three levels deep in the _secret template, it\u0027s not obvious to someone to who isn\u0027t familiar with the code.\n\nAs I said, I don\u0027t strongly object to this change (assuming we can get it to work), but I don\u0027t agree with the reasoning behind it. Too much added complexity, too little benefit in my view.",
