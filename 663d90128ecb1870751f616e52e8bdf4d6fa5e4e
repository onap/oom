User could obviously change it but it\u0027s a manual acction\n\n2) if config.dashboardPassword is not set at all then common secret template will generate a new password for every deployment (or for every masterPassword) to be more precise.\n\nSo is option #1 your intention?",

      "message": "I understand how the template works.  I intended option #1.  \n\nThis password is a placeholder--it isn\u0027t used. So it can be the same in every deployment. It would be used to authenticate to the inventory API, but the inventory API doesn\u0027t require authentication.  If the inventory API were to do authentication, then there would need to be a shared secret.  Either inventory would need to use the secret created here, or the runtime API would need to use a secret created by inventory.  If the inventory API were to do authentication/authorization via AAF, then it gets more complicated. In any of these cases, there would need to be changes to the Helm charts.\n\nSince the password doesn\u0027t matter, I will change this to make it randomly-generated. But the change is meaningless--it doesn\u0027t impact security, and it doesn\u0027t change anything about deployment.",
