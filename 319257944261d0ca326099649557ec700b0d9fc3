It makes onap user unsecure as consul UI is unprotected and that\u0027s main reason why it is not exposed as a nodeport.\n\nI would prefer that we describe only kubectl proxy method to be sure that only people who really know what they are doing would expose consul to the outside world.\n\n@Sylvain\nWhat\u0027s your point of view?",
