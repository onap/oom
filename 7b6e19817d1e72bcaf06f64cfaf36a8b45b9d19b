      "message": "Do we need a separate configurable path for backups or can we simply have a \"backup\" path that is relative to the persistence.mountPath? This ensures that when we only change persistence.mountPath, backups go where we expect them to go. Perhaps something that can be addressed in the next iteration of this feature.",
