      "message": "The [run for patcheset 3](https://logs.onap.org/onap-integration/gating/141289-3/) was better now.\nOnly `neng` [still has issues coming up](https://logs.onap.org/onap-integration/gating/141289-3/infrastructure-healthcheck/k8s-teardown/k8s-teardown/pod-onap-network-name-gen-cb7cd7d45-24c5d-network-name-gen.log) due to running in a java 11 base image.\n\nI gave it a closer look and basically the situation for all services in `ccsdk/apps` is that `neng` and `vlantag-api` are missing the `vintage-engine` dependency and thus were not executing their `junit 4` tests and `sliboot` is running it\u0027s test but only has 5.\nSo long story short is that these insufficient or not running tests made it possible to update the parent to the spring boot 3 one, which broke all those modules.\n[I started fixing it](https://gerrit.onap.org/r/c/ccsdk/apps/+/141510) for `neng`, but due to the amount of changes, this is not something that we should rush today I would say.\n\nSo my suggestion is to revert the `neng` changes in this OOM CR. We can then run another gating which I expect to be green then.",
