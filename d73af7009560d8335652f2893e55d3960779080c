      "message": "I think probably better to leave it for consistency with the other ones that seem to have it.   It seems to me that is more intuitive that the scope is specified when a new policy is created.   If the scope can be implicitly inferred from the policyName based on a \".\" separator, or something of that sort, seems to me can lead to ambiguities, but would like to avoid that discussion in this review.",
