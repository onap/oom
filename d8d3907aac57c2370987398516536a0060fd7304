      "message": "This is the first plugin published with SDC, but this folder can contain other plugins (jars).\n\nYou are right, we could embed this inside the application container, but I believe also that way we can configure which jars will be injected or not in the sdc-be plugin folder, during deployment time, by just adding or removing the plugin init images here.\n\nThat is the way we are doing in house that contains other plugins built outside the sdc build process.",
