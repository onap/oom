      "message": "There are likely more changes needed for the `a1policymanagement` chart. [Looking at the logs from the gating run](https://logs.onap.org/onap-integration/gating/141289-1/infrastructure-healthcheck/k8s-teardown/k8s-teardown/pod-onap-a1policymanagement-0-a1policymanagement-logs.html), the service is not coming up due to a `database-enabled` property that is set in the `application.yaml` [in the repo](https://git.onap.org/ccsdk/oran/tree/a1-policy-management/config/application.yaml#n37). Perhaps this is being overwritten by the chart.\n\nI think you\u0027ll have to update [the `application.yaml` in the chart](https://git.onap.org/oom/tree/kubernetes/a1policymanagement/resources/config/application.yaml) to fix it.\nThere also appear to be more values in there that should likely be defined. I think it\u0027s a good idea to basically copy over the one in the app repo to make sure it is in sync.\n\nIt would also be nice to make tracing configurable in a similar way like we do it in other places.\nThat is via a block in the `global`s of the chart to make it centrally configurable ([example here](https://git.onap.org/oom/tree/kubernetes/aai/values.yaml#n37)) and then [reference those values](https://git.onap.org/oom/tree/kubernetes/aai/components/aai-resources/resources/config/application.properties#n31) in the corresponding `application.yaml`.\nThe `management.tracing.enabled` is not currently defined for this service, but it would be great if we could add it.\nBecause it will lead to a ton of ugly log lines when tracing is on, but there is no jaeger deployed that could receive the traces.\nThat\u0027s why we have set `management.tracing.enabled` to `false` in all other places and made it globally configurable, such that it can be enabled with a single line of code when a jaeger is deployed.",

      "message": "I see way too many differences between the application.yaml in source and the one in the helm charts for my comfort.  Also, the version that I replaced (1.5.0) was quite old.  For now, I rolled back to that version and will ask the ORAN team to work a separate review to address the a1policymanagement microservice.",
