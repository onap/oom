Your current design is terrible. Doing sed from docker entrypoint script to apply configuration from helm chart is extremely fragile and may give unexpected results. Instead of that you should commit your config.py file to OOM repo, modify using provided values and then provide it in a ready form to container as a ConfigMap. For sensitive stuff you may use init container approach as for example here:\nhttps://gerrit.onap.org/r/#/c/oom/+/101856/",
