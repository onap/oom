      "message": "I\u0027m not sure that hostname is required. The service layer in k8s is responsible for publishing hostnames for the pods and routing requests to the pods behind the service. Only in certain circumstances should an override of the hostname be necessary.\n\nIn the KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS variable below it should be using {{ include \"common.fullname\" . }} as the \"hostname\".\n\nWhich would map to the service name defined in service.yaml.\n\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: {{ include \"common.fullname\" . }}\n\nHowever, I noticed that the name in the Kafka service.yaml file is not correct and should be changed to {{ include \"common.fullname\" . }}.",

      "message": "I would prefer to use in service .Values.service.name instead of common.fullname. This will provide a constant service, instead of one prefixed with the name of the helm deployment. It will enable deploying subsets of onap (components A,C,E in one command and B,D,F in another). Otherwise it is impossible, because the Release.Name part of common.fullname is different for each.",
