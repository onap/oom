      "message": "Hi Krzystof , this component is exposing rest endpoints that can be accessed by other clients using the credentials defined in the restServer-secret. K8s-secret is removed as it is not needed. These end points will also be accessed by users outside the cluster, so I have not auto generated the password here. Could you please confirm if the approach is fine in this case?",
