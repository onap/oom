      "message": "Just curious if the same can be achieved by uncommenting out this section.  This seems more like assigning the security group to the VM rather than where you have added it in this patch.  Where you have added is more like assigning the security group to the private network port attachment to the VM.  What is the difference?  If it is needed at the port level, then can we fully remove the SG section from VM to eliminate confusion?",
