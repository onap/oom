      "message": "It is really great that you are making use of the stable helm charts.  And as a longer term goal we may want to do more of this. For now, I would recommend reusing the embedded mariadb chart (see champ/charts/mariadb) instead of pulling the stable version. This sets the stage for use to move towards databases-as-a-service in the Casablanca timeframe. In addition you will get standardized/centralized configuration, and swappable PV/PVC/StorageClasses (coming soon).\n\nFor mongodb, it would be good to pull the stable version you are referencing, and default PV \u0026 PVC descriptors (use mariadb as a guide) and drop it into common/mongodb. This will be along side the other common db charts like mysql, postgres, mariadb-galera.",

      "message": "I believe that import-values allows you to pull configuration from sub charts of the parent chart (nbi in this case) into the parent chart. I don\u0027t think you can grab config from a chart that is at the same level within the onap umbrella chart. \nThere is a way to share common configuration between onap charts that involves templating a set of configuration (eg. Openstack params) and referencing them in sub charts like so, nbi and robot (where they are needed). Ping myself or Mandeep and we can guide you on this change. For now, just duplicate the config you need from so to get it working.",
