      "message": "As a general comment I was thinking that maybe it would be good to use this template to try to generate spec for already existing ServiceMonitor, like this one: https://git.onap.org/oom/tree/kubernetes/common/mariadb-galera/templates/servicemonitor.yaml. Perhaps even in this pull request so we could see how this template can be used and whether it works for this particular ServiceMonitor. I can already see that there are missing properties in spec-\u003eendpoints section like interval, scrapeTimeout, relabelings, metricRelabelings. Not sure if we want to support all those properties but it would be good to see actual usage of the template.",
