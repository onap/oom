      "message": "Actually I think it was correct using the .Release.Name.  Under Helm, release name is effectively a \"namespace\" and is required. Each instance of an ONAP deployment must have a unique release name. Where as the --namespace flag is optional in helm and is not something we will enforce.",

      "message": "I have to disagree on this.\nUsing Release.Name creates many directories under /dockerdata-nfs, making it impossible to distinguish data between different deployments of onap on same k8s. Therefore the only option to have multiple deployments of onap on same k8s is to use .Release.Namespace\nAlso, it looks much cleaner.",
