There is just more indirection.\nTHe proper solution for this is to change AAF to use derived passwords and store them into secrets that DCAE (and other AAF users) could access.\nPossibly adding the secret now will mean slightly less work in the future if the change is made to AAF, but apart from that I see no benefit and only added complexity.",
