##################### Elasticsearch Configuration Example #####################

# This file contains an overview of various configuration settings,
# targeted at operations staff. Application developers should
# consult the guide at <http://elasticsearch.org/guide>.
#
# The installation procedure is covered at
# <http://elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup.html>.
#
# Elasticsearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings,
# so you can try it out without bothering with configuration.
#
# Most of the time, these defaults are just fine for running a production
# cluster. If you're fine-tuning your cluster, or wondering about the
# effect of certain configuration option, please _do ask_ on the
# mailing list or IRC channel [http://elasticsearch.org/community].

# Any element in the configuration can be replaced with environment variables
# by placing them in ${...} notation. For example:
#
# node.rack: ${RACK_ENV_VAR}

# For information on supported formats and syntax for the config file, see
# <http://elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-configuration.html>
################################### Cluster ###################################

# Cluster name identifies your cluster for auto-discovery. If you're running
# multiple clusters on the same network, make sure you're using unique names.
#
# cluster.name: elasticsearch
*/}}
cluster.name: ES_AAI

#################################### Node #####################################

node.name: ES_ONAP
node.master: true
node.data: true

{{/*
# Use the Cluster Health API [http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health], the
# Node Info API [http://localhost:9200/_nodes] or GUI tools
# such as <http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/marvel/>,
# <http://github.com/karmi/elasticsearch-paramedic>,
# <http://github.com/lukas-vlcek/bigdesk> and
# <http://mobz.github.com/elasticsearch-head> to inspect the cluster state.

# By default, multiple nodes are allowed to start from the same installation location
# to disable it, set the following:

node.max_local_storage_nodes: 1

{{/*
#################################### Index ####################################
# You can set a number of options (such as shard/replica options, mapping
# or analyzer definitions, translog settings, ...) for indices globally,
# in this file.
#
# Note, that it makes more sense to configure index settings specifically for
# a certain index, either when creating it or by using the index templates API.
#
# See <http://elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules.html> and
# <http://elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-create-index.html>
# for more information.

# Set the number of shards (splits) of an index (5 by default):

#index.number_of_shards: 5

# Set the number of replicas (additional copies) of an index (1 by default):

#index.number_of_replicas: 1

# These settings directly affect the performance of index and search operations
# in your cluster. Assuming you have enough machines to hold shards and
# replicas, the rule of thumb is:
#
# 1. Having more *shards* enhances the _indexing_ performance and allows to
#    _distribute_ a big index across machines.
# 2. Having more *replicas* enhances the _search_ performance and improves the
#    cluster _availability_.
#
# The "number_of_shards" is a one-time setting for an index.
#
# The "number_of_replicas" can be increased or decreased anytime,
# by using the Index Update Settings API.
#
# Elasticsearch takes care about load balancing, relocating, gathering the
# results from nodes, etc. Experiment with different settings to fine-tune
# your setup.

# Use the Index Status API (<http://localhost:9200/A/_status>) to inspect
# the index status.


#################################### Paths ####################################

# Path to directory containing configuration (this file and logging.yml):
#path.conf: /opt/app/elasticsearch/config

# Path to directory where to store index data allocated for this node.
# Use swm auto link to redirect the data directory if necessary.

#################################### Plugin ###################################

# If a plugin listed here is not installed for current node, the node will not start.
#
# plugin.mandatory: mapper-attachments,lang-groovy


################################### Memory ####################################

# Elasticsearch performs poorly when JVM starts swapping: you should ensure that
# it _never_ swaps.
#
# Set this property to true to lock the memory: default is true

#bootstrap.memory_lock: true

# Make sure that the ES_MIN_MEM and ES_MAX_MEM environment variables are set
# to the same value, and that the machine has enough memory to allocate
# for Elasticsearch, leaving enough memory for the operating system itself.
#
# You should also make sure that the Elasticsearch process is allowed to lock
# the memory, eg. by using `ulimit -l unlimited`.

### Kernel Settings

# Elasticsearch installs system call filters of various flavors depending on the
# operating system (e.g., seccomp on Linux). These system call filters are
# installed to prevent the ability to execute system calls related to forking
# as a defense mechanism against arbitrary code execution attacks on
# Elasticsearch The system call filter check ensures that if system call
# filters are enabled, then they were successfully installed. To pass the system
# call filter check you must either fix any configuration errors on your system
# that prevented system call filters from installing (check your logs), or at
# your own risk disable system call filters by setting
# bootstrap.system_call_filter to false.
# See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/system-call-filter-check.html
#
# seccomp is found in Linux kernels: 2.6.37�2.6.39, 3.0�3.19, 4.0�4.9,
# 4.10-rc+HEAD
#
# The default setting is to disable the filters assuming an older kernel
# version where seccomp is not available.
# See: https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elasticsearch-warn-unable-to-install-syscall-filter/42819

############################## Network And HTTP ###############################

# on port [9200-9300] for HTTP traffic and on port [9300-9400] for node-to-node
# communication. (the range means that if the port is busy, it will automatically
# try the next port).

################################### Gateway ###################################

# The gateway allows for persisting the cluster state between full cluster
# restarts. Every change to the state (such as adding an index) will be stored
# in the gateway, and when the cluster starts up for the first time,
# it will read its state from the gateway.
# There are several types of gateway implementations. For more information, see
# <http://elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-gateway.html>.

# The default gateway type is the "local" gateway (recommended):
#
#gateway.type: local
#gateway.type: local

# Settings below control how and when to start the initial recovery process on
# a full cluster restart (to reuse as much local data as possible when using shared
# gateway).

# Allow recovery process after N nodes in a cluster are up:

# gateway.recover_after_nodes: 1

# Discovery infrastructure ensures nodes can be found within a cluster
