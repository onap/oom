      "message": "Don\u0027t you think that this will create a lot of mess in our charts?\n\nThink what we have now. Only 2 global values that has to be replaced if you want more than one onap instance in a single cluster. Every service decides whether to use prefix or prefixExt.\n\nAfter this change every service would need to specify nodePortPrefix as a value (number) which will result in absolute mess if you would like to have 2 onaps in single cluster.\n\nSo what I\u0027d suggest at bare minimum to make the service specific field templateable (if number use it if string execute tpl) so that someone may easily reference one of global values.\n\nBTW\nWhat\u0027s the goal of having a precedence between global prefix and global prefixExt? Are we ever going to have situation that global prefix is not defined?",
