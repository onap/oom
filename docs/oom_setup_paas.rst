Cert-Manager
============

Cert-Manager is a native Kubernetes certificate management controller.
It can help with issuing certificates from a variety of sources, such as
Letâ€™s Encrypt, HashiCorp Vault, Venafi, a simple signing key pair, self
signed or external issuers. It ensures certificates are valid and up to
date, and attempt to renew certificates at a configured time before expiry.

Installation steps
------------------

The recommended version of Cert-Manager for Kubernetes 1.19 is v1.5.4.
Cert-Manager is deployed using regular YAML manifests which include all
the needed resources (the CustomResourceDefinitions, cert-manager,
namespace, and the webhook component).

Full installation instructions, including details on how to configure extra
functionality in Cert-Manager can be found in the
`Cert-Manager Installation documentation`_.

There is also a kubectl plugin (kubectl cert-manager) that can help you
to manage cert-manager resources inside your cluster. For installation
steps, please refer to `Cert-Manager kubectl plugin documentation`_.

Installation can be as simple as::

  > kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.5.4/cert-manager.yaml

Prometheus Stack (optional)
===========================

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit with
an active ecosystem.

Kube Prometheus Stack is a collection of Kubernetes manifests, Grafana
dashboards, and Prometheus rules combined with documentation and scripts to
provide easy to operate end-to-end Kubernetes cluster monitoring with
Prometheus using the Prometheus Operator. As it includes both Prometheus
Operator and Grafana dashboards, there is no need to set up them separately.

Installation steps
------------------

The recommended version of kube-prometheus-stack chart for
Kubernetes 1.19 is 19.x (which is currently the latest major chart version),
for example 19.0.2.

In order to install Prometheus Stack, you must follow these steps:

- Create the namespace for Prometheus Stack::

    > kubectl create namespace prometheus

- Add the prometheus-community Helm repository::

    > helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts

- Update your local Helm chart repository cache::

    > helm repo update

- To install the kube-prometheus-stack Helm chart in latest version::

    > helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace=prometheus

  To install the kube-prometheus-stack Helm chart in specific version, for example 19.0.2::

    > helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace=prometheus --version=19.0.2
