# This is the main Search Guard configuration file where authentication 
# and authorization is defined.
# 
# You need to configure at least one authentication domain in the authc of this file.
# An authentication domain is responsible for extracting the user credentials from 
# the request and for validating them against an authentication backend like Active Directory for example. 
#
# If more than one authentication domain is configured the first one which succeeds wins. 
# If all authentication domains fail then the request is unauthenticated.
# In this case an exception is thrown and/or the HTTP status is set to 401.
# 
# After authentication authorization (authz) will be applied. There can be zero or more authorizers which collect
# the roles from a given backend for the authenticated user.
#
# Both, authc and auth can be enabled/disabled separately for REST and TRANSPORT layer. Default is true for both.
#        http_enabled: true
#        transport_enabled: true
#
# 5.x Migration: "enabled: true/false" will also be respected currently but only to provide backward compatibility.
#
# For HTTP it is possible to allow anonymous authentication. If that is the case then the HTTP authenticators try to
# find user credentials in the HTTP request. If credentials are found then the user gets regularly authenticated.
# If none can be found the user will be authenticated as an "anonymous" user. This user has always the username "sg_anonymous"
# and one role named "sg_anonymous_backendrole". 
# If you enable anonymous authentication all HTTP authenticators will not challenge.
# 
#
# Note: If you define more than one HTTP authenticators make sure to put non-challenging authenticators like "proxy" or "clientcert"
# first and the challenging one last. 
# Because it's not possible to challenge a client with two different authentication methods (for example
# Kerberos and Basic) only one can have the challenge flag set to true. You can cope with this situation
# by using pre-authentication, e.g. sending a HTTP Basic authentication header in the request.
#
# Default value of the challenge flag is true.
# 
#
# HTTP
#   basic (challenging)
#   proxy (not challenging, needs xff)
#   clientcert (not challenging, needs https)
#   host (not challenging) #DEPRECATED, will be removed in a future version.
#                           host based authentication is configurable in sg_roles_mapping
