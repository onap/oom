As you have seen with mariadb0galera we try to do this step by step. First we move all modules to use hardcoded but placed in secret credentials and only after we have that working we use the external secret functionality to unify all related secrets in given component\n\n\u003e Should something be done in the integration robot\u0027s healthcheck functionality to keep them in sync too?\n\nYou\u0027re perfectly right but it\u0027s the step after next step;)",
