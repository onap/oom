# These overrides will affect all helm charts (ie. applications)
# that are listed below and are 'enabled'.
#
#
# This is specifically for the environments which take time to
# deploy ONAP. This increase in timeouts prevents false restarting of
# the pods during startup configuration.
#
# These timers have been tuned by the ONAP integration team. They
# have been tested and validated in the ONAP integration lab (Intel/Windriver lab).
# They are however indicative and may be adapted to your environment as they
# depend on the performance of the infrastructure you are installing ONAP on.
#
# Please note that these timers must remain reasonable, in other words, if
# your infrastructure is not performant enough, extending the timers to very
# large value may not fix all installation issues on over subscribed hardware.
